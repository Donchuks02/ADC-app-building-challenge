# ADC-app-building-challenge
This repository is for the app-building challenge in which I participated at Arit Developer Circle.
The challenge is for newbie coders. We were presented with two versions: the simpler and harder versions.
I was able to do the simpler version.
**The Challenge**
Create a form with a single input field that takes a number (up to 2 decimal points) and a Submit button. When the user clicks the Submit button, a message should display asking the user if they would like to round up their purchase, along with the two buttons YES and NO. If the user responds yes, the value in the input field should update to the rounded-up amount. If the user responds no, no changes should be made.
